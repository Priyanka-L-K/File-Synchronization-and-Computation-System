# File Synchronization and Computation System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a client-server system implementing Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication. It features file synchronization operations and both synchronous and asynchronous computation functions.

## Key Features

### File Operations:
- **Upload:** Synchronize files from client to server
- **Rename:** Update file names with server-side reflection
- **Delete:** Remove files with synchronized deletion on server
- **Download:** Retrieve files from server to client

### Computation Operations:
- **Synchronous and asynchronous addition**
- **Synchronous and asynchronous sorting**

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented RPC communication for efficient client-server interaction
- Developed robust file synchronization mechanisms
- Created both synchronous and asynchronous computation functions
- Solved complex issues in file renaming and result management

## Challenges Overcome

- **File Renaming Issue:** Resolved duplicate file creation during rename operations by implementing a create-and-remove strategy, ensuring data integrity.
- **Asynchronous Result Management:** Improved result accuracy for asynchronous operations by implementing table dropping before inserting new results and adding strategic delays.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Client-Server Architecture
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- File System Operations
- Asynchronous Programming
- Problem-Solving in Distributed Systems
